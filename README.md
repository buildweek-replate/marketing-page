## Product Pitch

Many businesses have leftover food at the end of the day. Replate is an easy to use app that lets them effortlessly have those extras picked up by a Replate volunteer and donated to one of our worthy partner organizations. Choose a convenient time and a volunteer will show up and take your extras to a predetermined place of need.
